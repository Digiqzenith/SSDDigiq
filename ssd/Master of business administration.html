            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>In today's rapidly evolving global economy, the demand for highly skilled and versatile business
              professionals is at an all-time high. Organizations across various sectors are in constant need of leaders

              Administration (MBA) programme has long been recognized as a critical pathway for individuals aspiring to
              elevate their careers and achieve leadership positions. However, traditional on- campus MBA programmes
              often present logistical and financial barriers for many working professionals and those with personal
              commitments.</p>

            <p>To address these challenges, the MBA programme in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) mode Centre for
              Distance and Online Education (Formerly Directorate of Distance Education), Swami Vivekanand Subharti

              to business education is designed to cater to the needs of diverse learners, providing them with the
